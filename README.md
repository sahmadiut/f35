# F35

F35 is an end-to-end DNS resolver scanner for real tunnel testing.

It does not only ask a DNS question and call that a success.
It actually:

1. starts a tunnel client
2. uses one resolver from your list
3. waits for the tunnel to become usable
4. sends a real HTTP request through the tunnel
5. prints only resolvers that really pass traffic

This is useful when you want to find resolvers that still have outside connectivity during heavy filtering or shutdown conditions.

## Install

### Automatic (requires internet access)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahmadiut/f35/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone the repo and run:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

### Offline / Air-gapped Server

If the server has no access to GitHub or the internet, the installer will tell you:

```
[ERROR] No internet access — cannot reach GitHub.

  Action required:

  1. On a machine with internet, download the binary:

       https://github.com/sahmadiut/f35/releases/latest/download/f35-linux-amd64

  2. Transfer the file to this server, then re-run:

       ./install.sh --local-file /path/to/f35-linux-amd64
```

You can pass a locally downloaded file directly:

```bash
bash install.sh --local-file /path/to/f35-linux-amd64
```

Other installer options:

```bash
bash install.sh --version v1.2.0                        # install a specific version
bash install.sh --install-dir /usr/bin                  # custom install directory
bash install.sh --help                                  # show all options
```

## What Is A Resolver Here?

A resolver is the DNS server IP you want to test.

Examples:

```txt
1.1.1.1
8.8.8.8:53
10.10.34.1
```

If you give only an IP, F35 uses port `53` automatically.

## What You Need Before Running

You need all of these:

- a file with resolver IPs
- a working tunnel domain
- one tunnel client:
  - `dnstt-client`
  - `slipstream-client`
  - `vaydns-client`
- the extra flags that your tunnel client needs, passed with `-a`

## Build

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w -X main.version=$(git describe --tags)" -o f35 .
```

## Flags

- `-v`
  print version and exit
- `-r`
  file that contains resolver IPs
- `-e`
  which tunnel client to use: `dnstt`, `slipstream`, or `vaydns`
- `-d`
  tunnel domain
- `-a`
  extra flags for your tunnel client, for example pubkey, timeouts, log level, or custom tuning
- `-o`
  output file where found resolver IPs are written (one per line)
  default is `f35-results.txt` in the current directory
- `-bg`
  run in background (detaches from terminal)
  output is redirected to the `-o` file
  prints the background PID so you can stop it with `kill <PID>`
- `-x`
  proxy protocol F35 uses for the request through the tunnel
  this must match what your tunnel path or server-side target expects
  wrong `-x` can make healthy resolvers look dead
  default is `socks5h`
- `-U`
  proxy username if the tunnel exit requires authentication
- `-P`
  proxy password if the tunnel exit requires authentication
  `-P` requires `-U`
- `-u`
  test URL used for the probe request through the tunnel
  default is `http://www.google.com/gen_204`
- `-w`
  how many resolvers to test at the same time
- `-s`
  how long to wait before the HTTP test, in milliseconds
  this is important because the tunnel may need time to become usable
- `-t`
  probe request timeout in seconds
- `-probe`
  run a quick connectivity probe through the tunnel
  enabled by default
- `-download`
  run a real download test through the tunnel
  optional; also reports download speed (KB/s or MB/s) per resolver
- `-download-url`
  HTTP URL used for the download test
  default is `https://speed.cloudflare.com/__down?bytes=100000`
- `-download-timeout`
  timeout in seconds for the download test
  default is `5`
- `-R`
  number of retries for each resolver after the first failed attempt
- `-l`
  starting local port for local tunnel listeners
  useful if you want to avoid port collisions or run multiple scans
- `-p`
  full path to the tunnel client binary if it is not in `PATH`
- `-whois`
  run a whois lookup for resolver organization and country
- `-whois-timeout`
  timeout in seconds for the whois lookup
  default is `15`
- `-json`
  print one JSON object per result line instead of plain text
- `-q`
  suppress startup and completion logs

## Timeout Tuning

Use these as the main knobs:

- `-s`
  wait longer here if the tunnel starts too slowly
- `-t`
  raise this if the quick probe is timing out
- `-download-timeout`
  raise this if the download test starts but does not finish in time
- `-whois-timeout`
  raise this if the whois lookup is too slow

Good starting values:

- slow tunnel startup: increase `-s`
- weak or filtered path: increase `-download-timeout`
- slow whois API: increase `-whois-timeout`
- only probe fails: increase `-t`

## How `-a` Works

`-a` is only for tunnel client flags.

Examples:

- DNSTT:
  `-a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'`
- VayDNS:
  `-a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY -log-level info -udp-timeout 200ms'`

F35 automatically fills these parts for you:

- resolver address
- local listen address
- domain

For `dnstt`, F35 places `-a` before the positional `domain` and `listen` arguments.

## First Real Example

If you are new, start with something like this:

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e dnstt -d t.example.com -x socks5h -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

What this means:

- read resolvers from `resolvers.txt`
- use `dnstt-client`
- connect to `t.example.com`
- send the HTTP test through the tunnel using the `socks5h` protocol
- pass the public key to the client

## More Examples

### DNSTT

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt \
  -e dnstt \
  -d t.example.com \
  -x socks5h \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

### VayDNS

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt \
  -e vaydns \
  -d t.example.com \
  -x socks5h \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY -log-level info -udp-timeout 200ms -open-stream-timeout 7s -idle-timeout 10s -keepalive 2s -udp-workers 200 -rps 300 -max-streams 0 -max-qname-len 101 -max-num-labels 2'
```

### Slipstream

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt \
  -e slipstream \
  -d t.example.com \
  -x socks5h
```

### Proxy Auth With `-U` And `-P`

Use this if the proxy exposed by your tunnel requires a username and password:

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt \
  -e dnstt \
  -d t.example.com \
  -x socks5h \
  -U myuser \
  -P mypass \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

`-P` only works together with `-U`.

### Save Found Resolvers To A Custom File

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e dnstt -d t.example.com -x socks5h \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' \
  -o /tmp/working-resolvers.txt
```

Found resolvers are always saved to `f35-results.txt` in the current directory by default.

### Run In Background

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e dnstt -d t.example.com -x socks5h \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' \
  -o /tmp/working-resolvers.txt \
  -bg
```

Output:

```
f35 is running in the background
  PID:    38291
  Output: /tmp/working-resolvers.txt

To stop: kill 38291
```

### Run Download Test With Speed Reporting

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e dnstt -d t.example.com -x socks5h \
  -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' \
  -download
```

Each working resolver prints its download speed:

```
1.2.3.4:53 342ms download="ok" speed=1.2MB/s whois="off" probe="ok"
5.6.7.8:53 800ms download="ok" speed=87KB/s whois="off" probe="ok"
```

Speed colors on a terminal:

- green: `>= 512 KB/s`
- yellow: `128–512 KB/s`
- red: `< 128 KB/s`

### Use A Binary That Is Not In PATH

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e vaydns -d t.example.com -x socks5h -p ./vaydns-client -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

### Make The Scan More Conservative

This is useful when resolvers are slow but still usable.

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e vaydns -d t.example.com -x socks5h -w 50 -s 2000 -t 8 -R 2 -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

Meaning:

- fewer concurrent workers
- longer tunnel warm-up wait
- longer HTTP timeout
- retry failed resolvers

### Show Resolver Owner Info

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e vaydns -d t.example.com -x socks5h -whois -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

This keeps the enabled checks independent, and if the whois lookup succeeds, it also prints org and country for that resolver IP.

This is most useful when the resolver IP itself belongs to the network you care about.
If your tunnel goes into a more advanced upstream chain, this extra lookup can be less meaningful.

### JSON Output

```bash
f35 -r resolvers.txt -e vaydns -d t.example.com -x socks5h -whois -json -a '-pubkey YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

Use this if you want to parse the output in another program.

## Important Note About Advanced Upstreams

F35 does not generate advanced proxy protocol packets by itself.
It only sends a normal HTTP request through the tunnel using the protocol selected with `-x`.

Examples:

- if your tunnel path expects SOCKS, use `-x socks5` or `-x socks5h`
- if your tunnel path expects HTTP proxy traffic, use `-x http`

If you use something more advanced behind the tunnel, like `vless+ws`, F35 is not generating native `vless+ws` traffic.
It is only checking whether the tunnel path can move a request and return any response.

That means:

- the download request is the strongest signal
- whois and probe are weaker checks
- F35 does not require HTTP `200`
- even `400` or `404` can still prove that the tunnel is working
- `-whois` may be less useful in those advanced chains
- wrong `-x` can ruin scan results

## Output

By default, scan status is printed to `stderr` with a short `scan started` and `scan finished` line.
Use `-q` to silence those logs and keep only result lines on `stdout`.

Progress is printed to `stderr` after each resolver is scanned:

```
[15/100] working=3 remaining=85
```

In terminal mode, the progress line is updated in place.

### Normal Output

```txt
1.2.3.4:53 342ms download="off" whois="off" probe="ok"
5.6.7.8:53 89ms download="off" whois="off" probe="ok"
```

Only usable resolvers are printed.

A resolver is considered usable if at least one enabled check succeeds. By default, probe is the primary signal.
F35 does not require HTTP `200`.
Even a `400` or `404` can still prove that the tunnel is working.

Latency is colored on terminal output:

- green: `0-2000ms`
- yellow: `2000-6000ms`
- red: `6000ms+`

If you pipe the output to a file or another command, colors are not printed.

### Output With Download Speed

```txt
1.2.3.4:53 342ms download="ok" speed=1.2MB/s whois="off" probe="ok"
5.6.7.8:53 2140ms download="ok" speed=47KB/s whois="fail" probe="ok"
```

### Output With Checks

```txt
1.2.3.4:53 342ms download="ok" speed=1.2MB/s whois="ok" probe="fail" org="Iran Information Technology Company PJSC" country="Iran"
5.6.7.8:53 2140ms download="ok" speed=47KB/s whois="fail" probe="ok"
```

The output stays simple and the status fields always appear in the same order.

### Output With `-json`

```json
{"resolver":"1.2.3.4:53","latency_ms":342,"probe":"ok","whois":"off","download":"ok","download_speed_kbps":1228.8}
{"resolver":"5.6.7.8:53","latency_ms":2140,"probe":"ok","whois":"fail","download":"off"}
```

## Good Defaults For New Users

If you do not know what to tune first, try this order:

1. keep `-x socks5h`
2. if output is empty, increase `-s`
3. if working resolvers are slow, increase `-t`
4. if results are unstable, lower `-w`
5. if some resolvers fail randomly, add `-R 1` or `-R 2`

## Troubleshooting

### `binary ... not found in PATH`

The selected tunnel client binary was not found.

Fix it with one of these:

- install the client
- add it to `PATH`
- use `-p /full/path/to/client`

### No Output

Usually one of these is wrong:

- domain
- engine
- pubkey or other tunnel client flags inside `-a`
- wait time is too short
- timeout is too short

Try this:

```bash
-s 2000 -t 8 -R 1
```

### `-P requires -U`

If you set a proxy password, you must also set a proxy username.

### Very Few Working Resolvers

Try:

- lower `-w`
- increase `-s`
- increase `-t`
- add retries with `-R`

### I Do Not Know What To Put In `-a`

Put the same client flags you normally use when running your tunnel client manually.

F35 is not replacing your tunnel client config.
It is only fuzzing resolvers and local listen ports around that client command.
